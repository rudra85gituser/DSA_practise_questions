/*
if else statement
Problem statement
Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.

If-else is one of the ways to implement them.

You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b'.

Compare the numbers and print the relation.

Print “smaller”, “greater” or “equal” when ‘a’ is smaller than ‘b’, greater than ‘b’, or equal to ‘b’ respectively.

Example :
Input: ‘a’ = 5 and ‘b’ = 3

Output: greater

Explanation: Since ‘a’ (= 5) is greater than ‘b’ (= 3), we are printing “greater”.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
5 3

Sample Output 1:
greater

Explanation of sample input 1 :
Since ‘a’ (= 5) is greater than ‘b’ (= 3), we are printing “greater”.

Sample Input 2:
2 2

Sample Output 2:
equal

Explanation of sample input 2 :
Since ‘a’ (= 2) is equal to ‘b’ (= 2), we are printing “equal”.

Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(1).

Constraints :
-10 ^ 5 <= ‘a’ <= 10 ^ 5
-10 ^ 5 <= ‘b’ <= 10 ^ 5

Time limit: 1 second
